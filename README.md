**Hello Scurri Folks!!**

*IN PROGRESS*

Right now, there's a lot more discussion inline in the code than would probably remain, but it's how I often work myself through lots of detailed specifications.

The tests can be run via ```$python -m unittest test_postalcodevalidator```

The module itself can be imported as simply as:

```from ukpostalcodevalidator import validate```

and used with 

```result = validate(postalcode)```
